# Assigment 1 Part 1: The 7 Basis of Programming
There are 7 Basis of Prgramming: Primitive Types, Statements, Array, Static Method, String, Input/Output, and Data Abstraction. The first basis, Primitive Types, contains 8 sub-
types: byte, short, int, long, float, doubt, boolean, and char. Float is used to represent fractional number, Boolean is used to represent true/false, and char represents letters
numbers, and symbols. Regarding the remaining 6 types, statements have two types: Assignment Statement and Declaration statement. Like the name states, assignment statements have 
a value assigned to something (usually a variable. Declaration Statements declare a variable by specifying its data type and name. An array is  a collection of variables of the 
same type. Strings are tused to represent text instead of numbers.

# Assignment 1 Part 2: Character Encoding
Character encoding is used to teach the computer how to interpret zeros and ones into real characters. We need encoding in order to help us understand and better communicste with 
technology. ASCII is an example of a coding scheme, where different sets of ones and zeros represent different letters. For example, the set of numbers "0100010" represents "B" 
and "01000110" represents "F". There are 95 readable characters on the ASCII table. There charcters include letters, numbers and punctuation marks.
