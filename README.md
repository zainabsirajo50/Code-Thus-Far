# Assigment 1: The 7 Basis of Programming
There are 7 Basis of Prgramming: Primitive Types, Statements, Array, Static Method, String, Input/Output, and Data Abstraction. The first basis, Primitive Types, contains 8 sub-
types: byte, short, int, long, float, doubt, boolean, and char. Float is used to represent fractional number, Boolean is used to represent true/false, and char represents letters
numbers, and symbols. Regarding the remaining 6 types, statements have two types: Assignment Statement and Declaration statement. Like the name states, assignment statements have 
a value assigned to something (usually a variable. Declaration Statements declare a variable by specifying its data type and name. An array is  a collection of variables of the 
same type. Strings are tused to represent text instead of numbers.
